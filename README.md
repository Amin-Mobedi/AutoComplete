# AutoComplete
- a fast implementation of the autocomplete functionality
- The autocomplete task is to quickly retrieve the top terms that match a query string. For
example, if the query string is "Eng", your matches might be "English", "Engineering", and
"EngSci". In the project, matches are case-sensitive, and only the beginning of the string is
matched. "Eng" matches "EngSci" but not "engaged" and "Sci" matches "Science" but not
"EngSci"
